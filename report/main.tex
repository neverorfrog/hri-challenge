\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

In the context of RoboCup games, robots are fully autonomous and are not allowed
to receive any external help from humans. However, in a world where robots are
used in everyday life, they are of course used in collaboration with humans.
Moreover, the RoboCup 2050 challenge aims to have a football match between the
winning team of the RoboCup and the human winning team of the FIFA World Cup. In
this project, we aim to make a very small step in that direction by developing a
system that allows a human operator to remotely control and interact with a Nao
Humanoid through a graphical interface and a web socket. This pipeline was
specifically designed to be used in the RoboCup 2024 SPL challenge, where the
goal was to make two teams of robots play against each other, where one robot of
each team is controlled by a human operator.

\subsection{Objectives}
\label{sec:obj}

The main objective of the project is to develop that allows the human operator
to use the robot as a proxy to interact with the environment, namely the soccer
field. To do this, there is of course to need to have some form of bidirectional
interaction between the human operator and the controlled robot. The human needs
to be completely aware of the robot's surroundings, that is, the human can
perceive the robot's surroundings only through the robot's sensors. The robot,
on the other hand, has to be able to receive commands from the human operator
and execute them in real-time. The robot should also be able to send feedback to
the human operator in real-time.

\section{Solution}
\label{sec:sol}

We opted for a solution that prioritizes high-level commands and audio-visual
feedback. The main component of the system is the graphical interface. It is
made by a bunch of buttons that allow the human operator to send commands to the
robot and a 2D representation of the field that shows the robot's position and
some perception information.
